# COVID-19 Testing Visualizations

One of the biggest aspects of misinformation around the coronavirus outbreak is that much fear is inspired by the rising number of positive test results each day, despite the fact that much of this can be attributed to increases in the testing capacity of various states as time as gone on. More importantly, some states have been testing much more aggressively than others (for example, New York has been testing beyond what the federal government has given them, according to Andrew Cuomo).

In an effort to help clarify the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in various states and provide an accessible way of understanding testing overall, I have created an interactive map allowing the user to explore statistics about specifically testing in each state. Each time the code is run, latest data is pulled from the [Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/).
I will try to keep the map updated each day until I have the time to set up an automated system which pulls data as it newly becomes available.
